# Advanced-Consumer-Analytics-Data-Driven-Strategies-for-Market-Optimization

This project is not one project, but many different sub-projects. Depending on how much of the Data Scientist Career Path you have completed, or how many other projects you have done, this project may be primarily about organization and refinement. If you donâ€™t have any completed projects, this project may be the beginning of your journey to developing a portfolio.

Regardless of where you are starting, by the end of this portfolio-building project, you will have a job search-ready portfolio that shows off your skills.

We will not be providing step-by-step instructions, but we will provide a checklist of elements your portfolio should have and suggestions on how to develop those elements.

Project Objectives:
Collect and organize completed projects
Create new projects to fill in any skills gaps
Align your portfolio to your career goals
